# üèó aDebt

aDebt is a platform that enables aave credit lin holders to delegate their credit into a pool, where other aave token holders can vote on proposals on how to lend out the pooled tokens.

# Demo

Unfortunately due to technical issues on our end, we were unable to complete the contracts and the dApp frontend on time as required, so for now we'll just present the concept we had in mind.

We however intend to continue working on this project for the very long term and would loove feedback from the judges on the direction they would like us to take in the project going forward.
